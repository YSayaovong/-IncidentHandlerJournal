# Incident Handler Journal

This repository contains my incident handler journal entries from a cybersecurity course. The entries document various incident investigations and the use of cybersecurity tools, reflecting my learning process. The journal includes:

- Incident investigation entries using the 5 W's.
- Entries on tools like Suricata, Splunk, and Chronicle.

These logs are part of my portfolio to demonstrate incident handling skills and documentation techniques.
